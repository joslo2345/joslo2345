<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm Jose</h1>
<h3 align="left">A Mexican full-stack developer based in a rainy and tech city, Seattle WA US! .</h3>

I love a good challenge (and collecting my Pokemon cards). My passion is combining cloud programming, AI, and hardware solutions to build smart and efficient systems that get the job done faster 😎🤖🦾.

- 🔭 I'm currently exploring new opportunities as a Software Developer or AI Developer. For the past + years, I've been busy creating and implementing multiple APIs and frameworks on over 10 unique projects in both Mexico and the United States.
  I'm especially passionate about building things that make an impact. My experience even includes a stop at Microsoft, so I'm well-versed in working on large, complex systems. Looking forward to finding my next team!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about ***LLMs*** and taking ***IOS Apps Development course***.
- 😄 Interest: learning new things (everything! Including Music Theory and Cooking).
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him 💁🏻‍♂️
- ⚡ Fun facts: 
   - I love matcha. 
   - I am also an Bachata and Salsa dancer! 🕺🏻
   - I love to spoil my Girlfriend (and poke her 👀) (P.S. Her name means Princess 👸)
